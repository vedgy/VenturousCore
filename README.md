## Introduction

<b>VenturousCore</b> is a core library for a wrapper, which uses media player's
command line interface.
Currently only Audacious media player is supported, but adding support for
other players should be quite simple.
This library is used by Venturous - GUI wrapper. It can also be used by
command-line-interface wrapper.
This library depends on QtCore library. Both Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.
It also depends on vedgTools/CMakeModules, vedgTools/TemplateUtilities and
vedgTools/QtCoreUtilities libraries, which are present as a submodules in this
git repository (in `modules` directory).
