## Introduction

<b>VenturousCore</b> is a core library for a wrapper that uses media player's
command line interface.
Currently only Audacious media player is supported, but adding support for
other players should be quite simple.
This library is used by Venturous - GUI wrapper. It can also be used by
command-line-interface wrapper.
This library depends on QtCore library. Both Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.
It also depends on vedgTools/CMakeModules, vedgTools/TemplateUtilities and
vedgTools/QtCoreUtilities libraries, which are present as a submodules in this
git repository (in `modules` directory).
